## Introduction

Hello! I'm Venkat, a passionate learner and Computer Science student at Sairam Institute of Technology. This repository serves as a platform where I explore different technologies, experiment with coding challenges, and document my learning journey.

## Projects

Currently, this repository is a work in progress as I explore and learn new concepts. Here are some areas I'm interested in exploring:
- **Python Projects**: Learning Python and exploring its applications.
- **Data Analysis**: Using SQL for data manipulation and analysis.

As I progress, I plan to add more projects and expand my skills in these areas. Stay tuned for updates!
